# Minesweeper-Clone
First Semester Project. Written in C + Raylib.

I honestly don't remember how I used to compile this and I don't intend to change anything, so I'm gonna upload my entire working directory here.
Just remember to download Rayilb from official sources, and put the entire raylib directory (including the bundled w64devkit) inside this project directory.
